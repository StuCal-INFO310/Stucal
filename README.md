* **Share Events**
  * Sharing events with peers.
* **Free Time Finder**
  * Finding free time to study with peers.
* **View Key Dates**
  * Lists public events for the year, which can be added to dashboard.
* **Add Events**
  * Adding individual events to dashboard.
* **Search Events**
  * Able to search events by key words.
